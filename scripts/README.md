# Scripts

These are the scripts to create the local repository of all the episode data.

This saves us from making API calls we don't want to and helps keep things local.

Moreover, you don't need an internet connection to the thing.

Finally, the scripts are not that important either, as long as they are occasionally shown an update.

Also, not really scripts. It's a Jupyter notebook because I wanted an interactive environment.
