The three men introduce themselves as Frau, Castor, and Labrador- all bishops of the Church, which lies in the 7th District of the Barsburg empire.

Teito is about to leave the church when instead, he is brought to a place that seems to be the cafeteria by Frau. Though Teito begins to look for something else to eat when he sees that the meal of the day is Eye Stew. The sisters ask his name, but yet again, he hesitates. They say it's alright for him not to say his name. Later, Teito stumbles upon an old man who tells Teito he can grant his wish if he goes to the same spot at midnight. Teito decides to leave the Church and help Mikage. Teito then decides to run off by himself at night. Frau interrupts his thoughts, telling him that it might be his fate that he came to the Church.

Teito talks with the old man, and tells him his wish to see Mikage. The old man places an odd symbol on Teito's neck while Teito has a vision that he saw Mikage, and runs toward him. The flower that Labrador gave him from before stops him, and he realizes that the Bishops are there in front of him. Frau begins to attack the old man, who turns out to be a "Kor". Frau brings out from his arm, a large scythe, and he is shocked that Teito can see it. The Bishops fight the man, and though Teito wants to help, Frau tells him he will only hurt the man's soul. Frau manages to release the Kor from the old man's soul and then gets rid of the symbol on Teito's chest. Teito asks Castor what a Kor is. Kor are creatures that tamper with men's desires- they grant the man's wish, but he or she is then put into a string of dark events in which the person is never satisfied with his or her wishes and eventually falls into darkness, becoming a host for the Kor. In the morning, Teito is greeted by the sisters, who want to do his laundry. Teito is running away, when he bumps into Frau, who throws his underwear up. Teito catches it, but falls into the fountain, where he meets Lazet, a mermaid. Back at the Academy, Mikage makes his final choice: he won't betray his best friend.

Teito then exits the waterway and Hakuren appears and gives him a towel. That night they both decide to investigate the tower where Frau was arrested.</td></tr>

The boys are soon joined by Arch-Bishop Bastian, who tells them all about Frau's childhood.

They then realize that Bastian is the Warsfeil, so they rush after him. Meanwhile Bastian talks to Frau in his cell, then leaves. Teito and Hakuren successfully enter Bastian's room and find a secret passageway. At the end of the corridor is Bastian, who immediately attacks the boys, with the intent of killing Teito.</td></tr>

After being captured by Ayanami, Teito and Hakuren escape the military air ship and get support from Frau. After an intense battle the Eye of Mikhail attempts to save Teitos life by separating itself from Teito and taking the Wars with it. After separation the Eye unleashes its full power to destroy the enemies threatening Teito, making it rain fire upon the enemy air ships. Frau decided to save Teito and leave the Eye of Mikhail to fall in enemy hands. After cheering Teito up for losing the Eye of Mikhail, the other bishops give Frau a plant. Because bishop Bastian fell into the darkness, he was not reborn as a human, instead he was reborn as a tree. Frau planted the tree in the garden of the church so Bastian would be with them for many years to come. Teito finally recognises Hakuren as his friend and prepares for the bishop exam. On their way to the exam Teito accidentally steps on a key token that one of the bishops dropped and broke it. Unfortunately for Teito, that same bishop, Lance, is their head examiner...</td></tr>

The military found out about the Eye of Mikhail and its master, Teito, and decide to search for him. Teito finds out that his Zaiphon seems to have been drained since the leaving of the Eye of Mikhail. One of his friends gives Teito some of his energy to allow him to be able to continue. After the exam starts, all the aspirant bishops enter the first hall. This chamber uses the fear in peoples hearts to hold them down, after Teito gathers his resolve he manages to walk out as one of the first. The next challenge is to answer questions in several rooms using their Zaiphon while trying to stay alive. Halfway through the exam, Teito decides to help the old men to cross the rope bridge. Finally they reach the last challenge: the challenge states that only one of them can pass through the door of Victor and the other has to use the door of the Defeated. After fighting each other, the winner has to write his name on the wall before passing through the door of the Victor. After arguing about it, they both run off through the door of the Defeated, while writing "Damn You!" in place of the names. After passing, a voice inquires why they choose this door and Hakuren replies: "Nobody has been defeated and nobody has won" at which point Teito says: "I'm just here to be with my friend". Bishop Lance appears and tells them that their selfless solution made them pass.</td></tr>

After passing the first exam, Teito and Hakuren get to see the progress of others and how some fumble at the last challenge when their greedy nature makes them fail. Teito and Hakuren learn that the old guys they helped before were in fact Former Assistant Archbishops who tagged along to assess the progress of the participants. Meanwhile, the protectors of the church prepare for a dark threat as the military advances towards the church. Teito and Hakuren go to Lazet, the mermaid, as the Former Assistant Archbishops suggested and she takes them to an inner sanctuary where Teito gets to see his father and Father, the priest who raised him. He got told to never forget who he is, the Prince of Raggs Kingdom. Afterwards, they hurry back to the courtyard where bishop Lance is impatiently waiting for them. The second part of the exam is a challenge to face their inner daemons inside a room. They pass when they come out the other door. Hakuren starts off by defeating a gigantic Wars and Teito faces his biggest enemy: Ayanami in the flesh...</td></tr>

<p>The second exam resumes for the remaining trainees and comes in the worst form imaginable: the physical realisation of their deepest fears. When someone fails to overcome their fears, they fall through the bridge and fail.
Teito gets to face his biggest enemy, Ayanami in the flesh. After charging blindly at Ayanami, Teito gets to see visions of the hurt and pain he caused Mikage and his family.
Meanwhile, Hakuren finds his hated father on the ground with an unknown person in a black cape and weapon standing over him. Hakuren sees a vision of his father telling him he is no longer his son if he joins the church. The grim reaper tells Hakuren they should finish his father's pathetic, heartless life.
The constant talking about Hakuren finally gets to Teito who is starting to blame himself for everything he has done to his best friend. When Ayanami charges at him, he is petrified and unable to move to dodge the attack and gets impaled by Ayanami's sword.
Finally, the last trainees that haven't failed yet find the strength to face their fears. Hakuren saves his father and forgives him. Teito on the other hand is starting to go in shock. Some of the examiners worry for his life and urge bishop Lance to terminate the exam. It is then when Teito figures out that his real enemy is not Ayanami but himself, the part of him that is blaming himself for getting Mikage killed.

When Teito is ready and attempts to leave the second examination, the rest of the church gets invaded by the imperial army. And when Teito opens the door to exit the examination room, he finds himself in a dark, underground corridor instead of the exit. After a few seconds someone walks from the darkness towards Teito and this time, it is the real Ayanami who is standing in front of him with a dark smile on his face...</td></tr>

Ayanami appears in front of Teito and Teito wonders if Ayanami is just an illusion like before. Ayanami mocks Teito for still relying on the Eye of Mikhail when it is not even there anymore. Ayanami uses his Zaiphon to bring Teito and himself to the center of the earth, where he threatens "it is the first and last world you shall ever see". Teito attacks Ayanami, who mocks him for being weak. Ayanami tells Teito to attack him for real, and Teito asks why he is here. In the hall, Frau is still waiting for Teito to exit the examination room and Hakuren runs up to him to tell him that imperial forces have stormed the church. Suddenly, Kuroyuri appears saying he wants to kill the gardener (Labrador) who killed Haruse. Bishop Lance gets into a fight with one of Ayanami's men. Meanwhile, Ayanami has Teito beaten to the ground and asks Teito if his memories of traveling with Fea Kreuz have returned yet and reveals he is aware that Kreuz would certainly leave something to him. Castor captures the man who was the spy in the church and asks why he became a puppet of the military. Labrador erases the memory of the spy, so he may start anew when one of Ayanami's men kills him. Ayanami's men attack Castor and Labrador and Labrador is thrown aback. Bishop Lance defeats the man who was attacking him. Kuroyuri throws dark energy at Frau and tells him to show his true form as Zehel. Ayanami, meanwhile, is trying to access Teito's memories but Fea Kreuz (Vetrag) is stopping him. Ayanami's arm gets torn off and Teito realizes that Father was one of the Seven Ghosts. Ayanami's arm regenerates and Teito knows he has to live for those who died for him. He throws another attack at Ayanami that gets deflected and Ayanami tells him that he hasn't changed at all. Frau keeps using his scythe to cut away at the darkness that Kuroyuri is emitting. It seems Kuroyuri is falling apart from the same thing that killed Haruse. However, the more Frau attacks, the darker Kuroyuri becomes. Teito and Ayanami continue fighting, with Ayanami remaining dominant and continuing to mock Teito for being weak, and Mikage gets hit by one of the attacks. Teito runs to catch the falling Mikage and realizes he has to remember what he is fighting for. Kuroyuri is pushed back by Frau's light, which he calls love. Frau tells Kuroyuri his justice is flawed and the black flowers Kuroyuri was holding fade away. Ayanami tells Teito to search his memories for the location of Pandora's Box, or the hostages in the church will die until Teito remembers.</td></tr>

Teito uses the power of the Eye of Mikhail to summon Frau, Castor, Labrador, Lance, and the Black Hawks. He then sends them, himself, and Ayamani to a white place where they're surrounded by giant figures of the Seven Ghosts. Both groups start to battle each other in earnst. They become locked together in battle, until Ayamani splits the bonds. Then he and the rest of the Black Hawks disappear through a portal Kuroyuri summoned. Frau and the others disappear, too, leaving Teito alone with Mikage's spirit. They talk about how will Teito move on then Teito also leaves. Frau, Labrador, and Castor were all waiting for him as he exits the Bridge of Trials. They tell him that he passed the exam and is now an apprentence Bishop of Frau. Then they tell him that he and Frau are going to escape through a secret passage built for the Pope in case of emergency, Labrador explained that the secret passage has some twists and turns and they might get lost so Labrador summoned some flowers as their guide, then Frau and Teito said their farewells. Then Teito and Frau went inside the entrance on a Hawkzile. Teito bumps into Mikage's spirit, they talk briefly about what Teito will do. Teito declares his intentions of what he wants to do from now on, so they both said goodbye both of them where thinking they would meet again soon. So Frau and Teito got out of the secret entrance and escaped.</td></tr>
