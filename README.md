## Doing
- Integrate wikipedia search.
- Add internet connection checks.
- Write updates scripts for full reseed and reindex of anime episode databse.

## Done
- ~Parse anime episode data from Wikiepedia~
- ~Created primary data source for anime episodes...phew.~
- ~Create local index of all anime episodes.~

## Features
- I quickly realized that, rather than querying episode names or lists from wikipedia each time we run this app, it would be better to save a local copy inside some kind of csv. Not only is this more considerate with Wikimedia's API, we can just run a sync every now and then and we're good to go. I could even add a verify script which makes sure we have the latest corrections.
- I might still keep the wikipedia searcher, just for the sake of completeness.
- You should be able to auto-rename an entire series using the titles from Wikipedia.
